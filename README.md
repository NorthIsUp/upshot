======

upshot is an automatic screen shot uploader for OS X, written in Python.

> ''Note:'' This is experimental software and probably does not do what you want yet without massaging the source code.
> I drop ``XXX`` comments into the source code when I am cutting corners to make it easy to spot what needs fixed.
> As always, pull requests and Issues on github are welcome!
