**UpShot** combines the power of OS X's built-in screenshot functionality with Dropbox. This makes UpShot the easiest way to automatically upload and share screenshots on OS X.

**It's as easy as 1 - 2 - 3!**

1. You **take a screenshot**
2. The screenshot URL shows up in your clipboard, **ready to be pasted** wherever you want.
3. Actually, there is no step 3!
